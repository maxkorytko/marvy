# Marvy

An Android app, written in Kotlin, I built in my spare time in order to improve my Android development skills. It's a simple app that allows you to browse through a collection of Marvel characters and get some basic details about them. You can also search for a character by name.

The app is pulling the data from [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/) and [SuperHeroAPI](https://superheroapi.com/ids.html)
